# Fibonacci Indent

This totally-not-a-joke [Atom](https://atom.io/) package indents the selected text in Fibonacci style, i.e. the zeroth line is indented by 0 spaces, first line by 1 space, the second line by 1 space, the third line by 2 spaces, the fourth by 3 spaces, the fifth by 5 spaces, and you get the point. This package only indents the first 20 lines of the selection because Fibonacci numbers can get really large really quickly.

You can also keybinding `ctrl-alt-cmd-i` to Fibonacci indent your document in real time!

**WARNING:** Python support is still in beta.
